# Simple Calculator App

A **simple and responsive calculator** built with HTML, CSS & JavaScript.  
This project showcases my ability to implement fundamental **frontend logic** and build an interactive UI that handles core arithmetic operations.

## 🚀 Features

- Performs basic mathematical operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (×)
  - Division (÷)
- Supports **decimal numbers**
- Clear / reset functionality
- Responsive design that works on **mobile, tablet and desktop**
- Clean and modern UI focused on usability

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure  
- **CSS3** – Layout and responsive styling  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Application logic  
- Manipulating **DOM** to handle user interaction

## 🎯 What I Focused On

- Building a **real interactive app** without using frameworks
- Keeping JavaScript logic **clean, readable and maintainable**
- Handling edge cases like multiple decimals and chaining operations
- Designing a **responsive UI** that adapts across screen sizes

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User clicks buttons or uses keyboard input  
2. JavaScript updates the calculator display  
3. When “=” is pressed, the current expression is evaluated  
4. Results are shown instantly  
5. “C” clears the screen for a new calculation

This setup covers **basic application state management** and user interaction patterns common in web apps.
